      <h3 class="C1">Chicken</h3>
      <p id="para"> Chickens are domestic (farm) birds that cannot fly.
        The adult female chicken is called a hen, the adult male
         is called a rooster, and the young are called chicks.
          There are many different breeds of chicken that 
          are different sizes and colors. Bantams are miniature 
          chicken breeds. A group of chickens is called a flock.
           The scientific name of the chicken is Gallus
            domesticus (genus and species).  </p>

      <h3 class="c2">Beef</h3>
      <p id="para">In prehistoric times, humans hunted 
        aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that
         time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred 
         specifically for the quality or quantity of their
          meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed
           meat in the world, after pork and poultry. 
           As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, 
           and China were the largest producers of beef.</p>

      <h3 class="c3">Fish</h3>
      <p id="para">Cooking with direct heat occurs when you cook
         the meat directly over the heat source. The fish is cooked 
         quickly over medium or high heat coals or over burners set to 
         medium or high heat on a gas grill. Direct heat is used when grilling
          thinner fillets and steaks. Thin fish will cook quickly when grilled
           using direct heat. Because they are thin, the direct heat will cook them 
           thoroughly through to the middle.</p>
